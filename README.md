# SeeForMe
SeeForMe is an image captioning system that assists visually impaired users by generating audio descriptions of images. Using deep learning, it first performs high-quality image captioning to produce accurate captions, and then leverages an API to convert these captions into natural-sounding audio, making visual content accessible through sound.
